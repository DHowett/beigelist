0.frappliance breaks the Apple TV appliance Whitelist. Yay!
It's named 0 because that's logically before pretty much anything else. _ didn't work. :(.

Thanks to bholland, nitoTV, hedsick, and all of awkwardTV!

This readme has not been updated for a while ;) The latest incarnation of beigelist requires

0bacon.dylib mobile substrate tweak because it fixes a bug between AppleTV.framework and UIKit.framework - this was added in 4.4.x/5.0

The latest version is a merge of Espresso for 5.1 loading by Brandon Holland and the original beigelist.
